# Oriental Gent

## What is it
This is the website of a Chinese take-away restaurant that needed redesigning. 
It's a basic website with 3 different pages, 'Home', 'Menu' and 'Contact'.

## When did i make it
During my training at Becode to become a developer, we got the assignment to redesign a website. 
Over the course of a few weeks in March 2019, I learned a lot, which gave me the skills to improve this website.

## How did i make it
The site is written in HTML and CSS, using the Bootstrap framework along the way. 
It's fully responsive for all screen-sizes.
